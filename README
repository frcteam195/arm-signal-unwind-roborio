This is a fix to allow correctly unwinding signal frames on ARM EABI, e.g. as
result of throwing an exception.  Note that catching such exceptions is only
reliably possible if:
1. you compile with -fnon-call-exceptions, and
2. the signal is synchronous (e.g. SIGSEGV)

NOTE:  VFP/Neon and WMMX registers aren't restored yet.

The v1 signal frame format (kernels 2.6.16 and 2.6.17) isn't supported.
